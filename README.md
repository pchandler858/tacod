# TACO'D

A taco review site and community powered by::

- mySQL2
- sequelize
- express
- handlebars
- node.js
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- tailwindcss
- heroku

## Description

We were motivated to create a taco review site because other sites like Yelp are convoluted and don't focus on the most important part of the taco: the taco. With Taco'd, you can create an account, login, and post your own taco reviews. You can also view other users' reviews. 

Future updates will allow you to view top/tacos based on a location of your choice, edit your own reviews, and comment on and upvote/downvote other users' reviews.

Ultimately, we want to build a world community of taco lovers.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the correct file path in your command terminal and enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. Once installed, navigate to the db folder, and using your command terminal, login to your mySQL server and run 'SOURCE schema.sql;' to create the database. Return to the root folder and run 'node seeds/seed.js' to populate the database with sample data.

## Usage and Testing

Once necessary dependencies are installed, run 'npm start' in your command terminal to start your local server. Open a browser and navigate to your localhost port. Now you are able to play with the Taco'd by creating an account, logging in, and creating posts.

If you don't want to install but still want to use the app, follow the link below.
